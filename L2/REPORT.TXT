Questions:

0) What are the input(s) and output(s) of the system? what is the
   error signal you used to determine the force to be exerted by
   your controller?
        Inputs: mass of bar, length of bar, mass of cart, sampling rate, perturbation
        Outputs: Force
        We used the angle velocity and the angle to determine the force to be exerted by the controller.

1) What is the effect of m, m1, and l1 on the controllability of the
    system? what are the range of values for these variables that
    your controller can handle?

        If l1 is bigger, the angle changes slower so it's easier to control.
        If m is bigger, the cart moves slower from force, but it's still controllable.
        If m1 is bigger, the cart bar swings more from force, and it's much harder to control.

2) How does your controller work? explain to me the way this function
    decides how much force to apply. There should be a good reason for
    doing things, i.e. trial and error won't work well and won't result
    in a decent controller. Also, explain how you handled variations in
    the model's parameters.

        We used two PID controllers on both the angle and the angle velocity so that we could get to a reference state of
        a vertical bar.  To handle variation in weight of the cart and the bar, we used them together in a ratio for determining
        our PID k values.  To handle variation in length of the bar, we factored the length into our PIDs.  For sampling, we tried
        manipulating the force relative to the sampling rate, but this didn't end up working.  We didn't handle any cases for pertubation, as
        it should work regardless of what angle it starts on.

3) What is the effect of the sampling period sp on the ability of your
    code to control the pendulum?

       The sampling rate made our force apply too much/little force over time, and this resulted in our cart moving too much or too little
        which made it much harder to control the pendulum.  If the sp was 1, the cart moved smoothly.

4) In an actual system, sp is typically a function of how long it takes
    for the control software to do the required computations and update
    all required variables. Given your answer to 3), do you think that
    a standard operationg system such as desktop Linux or Windows are
    suitable for running control software for critical systems?

        Linux has a very accurate time system so it may be used for critical systems, Windows may work depending on the version of the
        OS.

5) You can easily balance an inverted umbrella, broom, or similar object
    on your hand. Do you think your brain builds a physical model of
    the system and then solves equations to accomplish this? if no,
    how do you think it manages to keep things balanced?

        No, there's too many variables that the brain keeps track of that cannot be modeled in a physical
        model.  It uses the complex nervous system functions in our brains that account for many factors that a
        control system cannot account for, and we use our previous experiences as well.
